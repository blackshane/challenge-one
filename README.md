# Challenge-one: Making code semantic and improving accessability to the impaired    
This application took starter code that relied solely on <div> tags and had sematic tags replace the non-descriptive tags in order to make the code easier to read of other programmers and also easier for assistive technologies like a screen reader to read as well.
In doing so the webpage becomes more assessable to users and it will also rank higher in search engines. Making it ideal for the owners of the page as well as its users. 
Some challenges faced include maintaining the relationship between the elements of HTML and CSS. When changing a tag or attribute, it is important to insure that your code is consistent across both applications to insure no conflicts that would cause the webpage to display in an unintended way.
